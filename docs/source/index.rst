Welcome to Pharmacokinetic Modelling Project's documentation!
=============================================================

**Pharmacokinetic Modelling Project** is a Python library for specifying, solving, and visualising
the solution of a Pharmacokinetic (PK) model. A PK model quantitatively describes the movement of a drug through
a patient by modelling the drug delivery, diffusion of the drug through the body, 
and clearance of the drug from the body.
